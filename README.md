## Design Patterns Covered

### 1. **Factory Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.  
- **Use Case:** When you want to decide which class to instantiate at runtime.  

### 2. **Builder Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Helps construct complex objects step by step.  
- **Use Case:** Useful when creating objects with many optional parameters.  

### 3. **Singleton Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
- **Use Case:** For managing shared resources like configuration or logging.  

### 4. **Strategy Pattern**
- **Purpose:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  
- **Use Case:** When you want to select an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime.
